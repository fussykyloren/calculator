# Calculator
## Information
In this project, a calculator is implemented using Javascript.  This project is part of The Odin Project Javascript curriculum. The project information can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/calculator).
## Instructions
This calculator funcions no differently that a common one. There are a few things to note. First, dividing by 0 will clear the calculator and prompt an error message. All decimals are rounded to 6 decimal places (if necessary). Pressing the 'AC' button clears all info in the calculator. The 'DEL' button will remove the last number entered. Lastly, the calculator can handle mulitple operations before the '=' button is pressed.
